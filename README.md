# Drawing a tree

A code playground to draw a tree on the screen.

[![Edit taktran/drawing-a-tree](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/taktran/drawing-a-tree/tree/master/?file=/README.md)

## Why?

To have some fun and learn about creative graphics programming.

## Why a tree?

I like trees, and they are a simple and easy to recognise object. This means the project can be as simple or as complicated as I want it to be.

It's also an exploration for [Forest in the Tree](https://www.forestinthetree.com/).

## Tech stack

- [Pts.js](https://ptsjs.org/) for drawing pixels. I like its [humanist and philosophical](https://medium.com/@williamngan/pt-93382bf5943e) approach to drawing
- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for scaffolding the project. Simple, easy and quick way to get a static webpage project up and running
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) for hosting and running the project. The setup of a modern web stack with a built in VSCode editor, without the fuss of having to set it up locally. Also makes it very simple to share results. Integration with Git for version history is really nice too
